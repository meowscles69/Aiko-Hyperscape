# Aiko Hyperscape

**Aiko Hyperscape** is an experimental 3D world inspired by **Old School RuneScape**, built around **Aiko** — an AI companion living inside a persistent, low-poly environment.

The project prioritizes **feel first**: movement, scale, camera behavior, and atmosphere before complexity or systems.

This is not a game yet.  
It’s a world prototype.

## What This Is

Aiko Hyperscape explores how AI agents can exist inside spatial environments rather than chat boxes.

The focus is on:
- How it *feels* to move through a world  
- How scale affects perception  
- How camera behavior changes immersion  
- How an agent’s presence alters a space  

Everything is designed to be calm, readable, and intentional.

## Features

- RuneScape-inspired 3D world layout  
- OSRS-style camera (mouse wheel orbit + tilt)  
- WASD movement  
- Low-poly terrain, trees, and props  
- Character scaling tuned for RuneScape proportions  
- Walk + idle animation system  
- UI overlays for skills, chat, and status  
- Designed to evolve alongside ElizaCloud agents  

---

## Controls

- **W / A / S / D** — Move  
- **Mouse Wheel Scroll** — Zoom camera  
- **Mouse Wheel Click + Drag** — Orbit camera  

Camera always orbits the character.  
No free-fly camera.  
Movement is slow and deliberate.

---

## Philosophy

This project is intentionally minimal.

There are:
- No combat systems  
- No monetization  
- No hype mechanics  

The goal is to establish a **baseline feel** for agent-driven worlds before layering complexity.

Status

Active experiment.
Expect rough edges.
Expect iteration.
