# Aiko Hyperscape

**Aiko Hyperscape** is an experimental 3D world inspired by **Old School RuneScape**, built around **Aiko** — an AI companion living inside a persistent, low-poly environment.

This project focuses on **feel first**: movement, scale, camera behavior, and atmosphere before complexity.

This is not a finished game.  
It’s a world prototype.
