Aiko Hyperscape

Aiko Hyperscape is an experimental 3D world inspired by RuneScape, built to explore AI agents, movement systems, and interactive environments inside the ElizaCloud ecosystem.

This project focuses on feel first: how agents move, exist, and interact in a shared space—before optimization, monetization, or scale.

Vision

Create a lightweight, RuneScape-inspired 3D world

Experiment with AI agents as in-world entities

Explore movement, camera, and interaction mechanics

Build toward persistent, explorable environments

Stay simple, readable, and hackable

No hype. No promises. Just building.

Current Features

3D open environment

Player character (Aiko)

Basic movement and camera controls

World objects (terrain, trees, rocks)

UI elements inspired by OSRS

Early interaction hooks (XP, actions, logs)

Goals (In Progress)

RuneScape-style proportions and scale

Smooth walk / idle / emote animations

Mouse-wheel orbital camera (OSRS-like)

Larger, stylized trees and landmarks

In-world UI nodes (About, Contract, Community)

AI agent behaviors and NPC logic

Tech Stack (subject to change)

3D engine: TBD (Three.js / Babylon.js / Unity / Godot)

Frontend: Web-based

Assets: Low-poly, OSRS-inspired

AI: ElizaCloud agents

Hosting: TBD
